# Musical-instrument-detection
Detecting musical instruments in an audio using Deep learning.

In this project we are detecing different instrumets that are in an audio using deep learning.

We are taking Dataset from <a href="http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples"> London Philharmonic Orchestra Dataset</a>

we  will be clculating MEL-spectrograms values and feeding them to CNN network.
we are using Convolutional neural network for classification purpose.
